    <h1>Omni-Shell: The Last Epoch</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Matrioshka Brain</strong>—a massive, failing Dyson sphere surrounding a star. You are a post-human consciousness living within this machine. Reality is a computational substrate where ships are mobile processors, and combat is both physical and informational.</p>

    <h2>1. The Core Objective: Processing is Power</h2>
    <p>In Omni-Shell, the ultimate goal isn't just to "destroy a base," but to secure the resources required for your digital existence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycle-Time (CT):</strong> This is the universal currency representing literal seconds of processing power. You need it to exist, upgrade, and repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the Cores:</strong> Ships and stations run on <strong>Processor Cores</strong>. Disabling these is the primary way to win a battle, as it turns enemy vessels into salvageable derelicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Factions:</strong> Different groups compete to either rebuild the machine, preserve its current state, or seek transcendence elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Dual-Layer Battlefield</h2>
    <p>Every battle happens in two dimensions simultaneously. You can switch between them, or coordinate with teammates who specialize in one layer.</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Layer</th>
                <th>Who Plays Here?</th>
                <th>Your Goal</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Physical Layer</strong></td>
                <td>Pilots, Gunners, Engineers</td>
                <td>Focus on kinetic combat. Use lasers and railguns to blast through the ship's <strong>Voxels</strong> (blocks) to create entry points.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Ghost Layer</strong></td>
                <td>Hackers, Wraiths, Architects</td>
                <td>Phase inside enemy ships as a "Ghost." Sabotage internal systems like shields or life support while physical combat rages outside.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. Economy & Currencies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycle-Time (CT):</strong> Earned through missions, selling resources, or even renting out your own processing power to others.</li>
        <li><strong>Sub-Routines:</strong> These are AI crew members. They have personalities and skills. You must keep them loyal and "patch" their code to keep them effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Voxel Construction:</strong> Ships are built block-by-block. Every block (thrusters, shields, processors) has a function and a CT cost to build.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Convoy Logistics (The Strategy Loop)</h2>
    <p>Resources aren't teleported; they must be physically moved between the Shells (layers) of the star-machine.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Trade:</strong> You haul raw materials from the inner layers to the outer layers to make a profit.</li>
        <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> Moving a convoy makes you a target. You must balance the cost of hiring escorts (players or Sub-Routines) against the potential profit of the trip.</li>
        <li><strong>The Reward:</strong> Large-scale logistics allow you to fund massive fleet operations and high-end digital upgrades.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Basic Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Your "Class" (e.g., <em>Monolith</em> for speed/precision, <em>Archive</em> for storage/tanking).</li>
        <li><strong>Tether:</strong> The digital line connecting your Ghost form to your body. If an enemy hacker cuts this, you are trapped or "killed."</li>
        <li><strong>ICE:</strong> "Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics"—automated AI guards that hunt hackers in the Ghost Layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Breach:</strong> A hole in the ship's physical hull that allows Ghosts to enter.</li>
    </ul>
