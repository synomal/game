    <h1>Omni-Shell: The Last Epoch</h1>
    [cite_start]<p>Welcome to the <strong>Matrioshka Brain</strong>—a massive, failing Dyson sphere surrounding a star that houses all of post-humanity[cite: 25, 26]. [cite_start]In this universe, reality is a computational substrate where ships are mobile processors and combat is both physical and informational[cite: 26].</p>

    <h2>1. The Core Objective: Processing is Power</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Unlike traditional RTS games where you simply destroy a base, the objective here is driven by the survival of your digital consciousness[cite: 25, 27].</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Accumulate <strong>Cycle-Time (CT)</strong>, which represents literal seconds of processing power needed to exist and grow[cite: 56, 59].</li>
        <li><strong>The Conflict:</strong> You fight to control <strong>Processor Cores</strong>. [cite_start]Losing all cores makes a ship derelict[cite: 39, 40].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Success:</strong> You "win" by disabling enemy systems, stealing cargo data-signatures, or salvaging "Crystallized Computation" from the inner layers of the star[cite: 15, 31, 44].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Dual-Layer Battlefield</h2>
    <p>Combat happens in two dimensions at the exact same time. [cite_start]Players must coordinate between these layers to be effective[cite: 3, 85].</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Layer</th>
                <th>Who Plays Here?</th>
                <th>What You Do</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Physical Layer</strong></td>
                [cite_start]<td>Pilots, Gunners, Engineers [cite: 3]</td>
                [cite_start]<td>Fly ships and use weapons to destroy <strong>Voxels</strong> (blocks), creating "breaches" in enemy hulls[cite: 39, 89].</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Ghost Layer</strong></td>
                [cite_start]<td>Hackers, Wraiths, Architects [cite: 3, 9]</td>
                [cite_start]<td>Phase through hull breaches as a digital "Ghost" to sabotage internal systems like shields or life support[cite: 4, 87, 92].</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. Economy & Currencies</h2>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Cycle-Time (CT):</strong> The universal currency[cite: 56]. [cite_start]Everything from ship repairs to buying new abilities (Instruction Sets) costs CT[cite: 57, 61].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Sub-Routines:</strong> Your NPC crew[cite: 34]. [cite_start]These are AI fragments you find, hire, or create to pilot your ships or manage systems[cite: 35, 47].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The Supply Chain:</strong> Resources like <strong>Stellar Plasma</strong> and <strong>Exotic Matter</strong> must be physically hauled through "Shells" to be refined into ship parts[cite: 42, 43].</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Convoy Logistics (The "RTS" Loop)</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Because resources must travel physically between the layers of the Matrioshka Brain, the economy relies on <strong>Convoys</strong>[cite: 45, 46].</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Hauling:</strong> You accept contracts to move goods across high-risk "Hyper-Beam" highways or slow "Dead Zones"[cite: 46, 51, 52].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Protection:</strong> You must assign Sub-Routines (Pilots, Gunners) or player escorts to defend these slow-moving freighters from being boarded by Ghost armies[cite: 14, 47].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Profit is calculated by balancing the risk of piracy against the cost of fuel and speed[cite: 54].</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Basic Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Your character's build (e.g., <em>Monolith</em> for precision, <em>Archive</em> for tanking)[cite: 28, 30].</li>
        <li><strong>Tether:</strong> The glowing line connecting your Ghost form to your physical body. [cite_start]If it’s cut, you are trapped[cite: 90].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>ICE:</strong> Automated digital defense programs that hunt hackers inside a ship's Ghost Layer[cite: 95].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Logic Bomb:</strong> A digital virus planted by a hacker that eventually explodes, damaging the physical ship from the inside[cite: 93].</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Would you like me to expand on the specific "Ghost Roles" like the Wraith or the Surgeon to see how they interact with these convoys?</em></p>
